# rxmind - Your Personal Health Tracker

## Introduction

*rxmind* is a personal health tracking app designed to help me monitor and improve my overall well-being. Developed by a dedicated developer(myself) for my personal use, this app focuses on utilizing HealthKit data to provide insights into my daily step count towards my achilles rupture healing until I can attempt sprinting again, my heart rate, HRV (Heart Rate Variability), and stress levels. The primary goal of *rxmind* is to remind me to practice controlled breathing, goal orientated inspired action when looking at my goal timer countdown component, and practising calming actions to reduce my anxiety & stress.

## Features

- *Step Counter*: Keep track of  daily steps and set a timer for any goals with core data.
- *Custom Interface for Shanré*: An UI built for my own visual wants and needs - designers will think I've lost the plot. I might have, but who cares.
- *Heart Rate Monitoring*: Monitor heart rate and keep an eye on your cardiovascular health. Stressful heart is a heart becoming weaker.
- *HRV Analysis*: Gain insights into your heart rate variability and understand your body's stress response.
- *Stress Level Indicator*: Utilises HRV data to measure  stress levels to be reminded of those levels.
- *Biometric Security*: Secured health data with biometric authentication (Face ID ).

## Motivation
